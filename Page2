        I have really enjoyed learning how to code this website!

    In my final stretch at North Carolina State University, I believe I have found something that I would like to explore further. On the previous page, I mentioned an educational technology tool that I personally am passionate about, Formative. In the future, if I am employed by this company, I would like to explore how I can apply my new tech skills to this emerging technology.

      <h3> Favorite Ed. Tech Tools 
    </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Formative: I am especially fond of Formative because I personally believe it could be an online educational tool (learning management system) that could solely bridge the achievement gap between students of color and their white peers
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <a href="https://www.formative.com">This is a link to Formative</a>
                </ul>
            <li>Padlet: I like Padlet because it allows individuals to collaborate in real time either under a username or annonymously if preferred.
                 </li>
            <li>Blackboard: While Moodle is effective, I personally think the learning management system, Blackboard, is more efficient. It is easier to navigate and makes communicating with professors and peers a more seamless process all within the learning management system itself.
                    </li>
        </ol>

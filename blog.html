            Where Do I See Myself in Ten Years?
        </strong>
    </h1>
    <div>
    <p>
        I would like to start in Instructional Design while I am still working to develop my knowledge of different programming languages. I am passionate about making the learning process inviting and not so intimidating, no matter the subject. For example, code. 
    </p></div>
    <div>
    <p>
        I would then like to start to pursue, possibly, a Masters Degree in Training in Development. I know that drafting quality instruction is the primary goal, but what does quality mean to each individual learner? I have become passionate about evaluation because of my commitment to making learning inviting and accommodating, no matter the subject and no matter the learner.
    </p></div>
    <div>
    <p>
        During the next ten years, I would like to work on developing my coding abilities. Something as intimidating and meticulous as writing code deserves quality instruction that every learner can benefit from when implemented and/or tested. In the future, I  hope to develop a learning management system that is specifically catering to training technical skills. At this point in time, I am barely qualified to code this entire website, but am looking forward to what my continuing coding education will teach me.

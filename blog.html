        <div id="column2">
        I would like to start in Instructional Design while I am still working to develop my knowledge of different programming languages. I am passionate about making the learning process inviting and not so intimidating, no matter the subject. For example, code. In addition to making learning inviting, I dream of a public education system that is inclusive. This is a journey that we as a nation are still on, and I hope for perseverance as challenges inevitably surface. To think how truly amazing this country, and globe, could be if every individual had access to a truly quality education with equal opportunities.

         <div id="column2">
             I would then like to start to pursue, possibly, a Masters Degree in Training and Development. I know that drafting quality instruction is the primary goal, but what does quality mean to each individual learner? I have become passionate about evaluation because of my commitment to making learning inviting and accommodating, no matter the subject and no matter the learner. Thorough evaluation of any program is key to ensuring it is delivering a quality product. Not just for one learner, but for each individual learner.
             </div>
        <div id="column3">
        During the next ten years, I would like to work on developing my coding abilities. Something as intimidating and meticulous as writing code deserves quality instruction that every learner can benefit from when implemented and/or tested. In the future, I  hope to develop a learning management system that is specifically catering to training technical skills. At this point in time, I am barely qualified to code this entire website, but am looking forward to what my continuing coding education will teach me, and then later how I can use my own education to teach others.
